# 42SchoolCHeader

42SchoolCHeader OOP and Template Library in C. 

The 42SchoolCHeader library is inspired by the 42 school library libft and is a logical continuation of the latter.

The 42 School C Header library is implemented in the programming language C. The 42 School C Header library can be divided into 4 parts.

	1․  C is easy.
        A set of functions based on the principles of procedural programming, which are considered the analogs of 
        functions available in the standard library of the C programming language, more secure versions or the ones  
        that extend the functionality of the library. 
	2․  The data processing tools implemented in OOP style and concept. In particular, the tools with the likes of 
        c_string for char, c_vector_string and c_file_editor for making the working process on file contents more 
        convenient operation are available. 
 	3․  The data structures developed using the principles of metaprogramming, which store information in the 
	    void * type and manage it through Preprocesor macro and the c_type_ctrl sub-library from 42SchoolCHeader library.
	4․  Other tools, sub-libraries, testers.
  
The basic structure of the 42SchoolCHeader library․

	1․  libft (library contents are private).
	2․  c_string char's managment tools․
          a.  c_sstring (c static string). A string tool, implemented in the C programming language, which 
              works in static memory and is functionally analogous to the C++ string tool.
	      b.  c_dstring (c dynamic string). Astring tool, implemented in the C programming language, which 
              works in dynamic memory and is functionally analogous to the C++ string tool.
          c.  c_string (c string). A string tool, implemented in the C programming language, which 
	          works both in static and dynamic memory and is functionally analogous to the C++ string tool.
 	3.  c_array_int int array management tools ․
	      a.  c_sarray_int (c static array int). An array tool, implemented in the C programming language, which stores int
		  values, works in static memory անդ is functionally similar to the C++ array<int> tool.
	      b.  c_darray_int (c dynamic array int). An array tool, implemented in the C programming language, which stores int
		  values, works in dynamic memory and is functionally similar to the C++ vector<int> tool.
	      c.  c_vector_int (c vector int). An array tool, implemented in the C programming language, which stores int
		  values, works both in static and dynamic memory and is functionally similar to the C++ vector<int> tool. 
	4․  c_array_string tools for working with two-dimensional arrays of the char type
	      a.  c_sarray_string (c static array string). An array tool, implemented in the C programming language, that stores 
              c_string values, works in static memory and from the point of view of functionality, it is the analog of the
              C++ sarray<string> tool.
	      b.  c_darray_string (c dynamic array string). An array tool, implemented in the C programming language, that stores
              c_string values, works in dynamic memory and from the point of view of functionality, it is the analog of the 
              C++ darray<string> tool.
	      c.  c_vector_string (c vector string). An array tool, implemented in the C programming language, that stores
              c_string values, works both in static and dynamic memory and from the point of view of functionality, it is 
              the analog of the C++ vector<string> tool.
	5․  c_file, file content management tools
          a.  get_next_line ․ (the software implementation of the tool is private).
	      b.  c_file․ a tool for primitive work with the contents of the intended file: "open", "close", "input", 
		  "output", "get the number of lines in the file". It is implemented in the C language and its file descriptors.
          c.  c_file_editor ․ A tool for working with the contents of a file. The tool allows you to "crawl the 
		  contents of the file", "make changes to the index string", "save the contents of the file in the 
		  specified location", "duplicate the file" , etc. It is implemented in C using the tools of the stdio 
		  library, which are part of the standard library of the C language.
	6․  c_file, file content management tools
          a.  c_varray (c void * array). An array tool, based on metaprogramming principles, that works in static memory.
	      b.  c_vvector (c void * vector). An array tool, based on metaprogramming principles, that works in dynamic memory.
	      c.  c_vlist (c void * list). An list tool, based on metaprogramming principles, that works in dynamic memory.
	7․  c_is_easy library, which is a more secure version of the libft library.
        A number of actions are automated և make the further "code generation" process faster.

With the 42SchoolCHeader library software, there are testers who check the effectiveness of the tools.

Disadvantages.

	1․  Software implementations could definitely be better. There was no task to implement it as efficiently as 
	    possible, the task was to study OOP, meta-programming macro work at C level. The author of the project believes 
        that those who will be able to implement the concepts of OOP in the C programming language will have a clearer 
        idea of OOP in C++. With the software implementation of the 42SchoolCHeader library, the author has acquired a
        lot of new knowledge and considers the task more than completed.
	2 ․ Despite the fact that a lot of testing has been done, it should be taken into consideration that the author of
        the 42 School CHeader library does not like to test code, and assures that there are many bugs in the code. 
        It does not apply to a dynamic memory leak.The author has repeatedly checked and tested the software 
        implementation and believes that if the tools are used correctly, there should be no leakage of dynamic memory.

  Sincerely, 
  V. Gishyan.
